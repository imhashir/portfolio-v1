## About

> I am a developer by profession (and luckily by hobby as well!). 

I have been working as a freelancer since March 2018 and its been a great experience so far. I have worked with clients from US, UK, Canada, Netherlands, France and many more countries. I have developed a lot of interesting products ranging from small automation scripts to large scale mobile apps and websites taking advantage of full potiential of AWS Cloud technologies and facial recognition systems.
